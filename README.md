Fake News Detection

This project is an intelligent system for detecting fake news using Machine Learning techniques. The system analyzes the text of news and classifies them as "true" or "fake" with high accuracy.

Project Features

The system cleans news text and uses TF-IDF for feature extraction. Multiple ML models are tested, with an average accuracy of 99% across all algorithms, providing reliable fake news detection with consistent high performance.

Results

The project achieved excellent results with four different algorithms:
•	Logistic Regression: 98.5% Accuracy
•	Decision Tree: 99.5% Accuracy
•	Gradient Boosting: 99.5% Accuracy
•	Random Forest: 98.6% Accuracy

Technologies Used
•	Python - Programming Language
•	Pandas & NumPy - Data Manipulation
•	Scikit-learn - Machine Learning Algorithms
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn - Visualizations

Dataset Structure
The project uses two main datasets:
•	Fake.csv - Fake News (23,481 rows)
•	True.csv - True news (21,417 rows)

How It Works
1.	Data Loading - Read news datasets
2.	Processing - Clean and process text
3.	Train/Test Split - Split data for training and testing
4.	Vectorization - Convert text to numeric form
5.	Training - Train ML models
6.	Testing - Evaluate model performance
7.	Prediction - Manual testing with new news

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Machine Learning in detecting fake news and provides a solid foundation for further developments in the field of news verification.
